Our paper is also in the folder. The folder contains following five python files:

1) launch_DCS.py
This file contains some basic commands and executes the code. Execute this file to get the results. All the results will be stored in the communities file in this folder. We have also added comments in the code for the reader's convenience.  
2) local_centrality.py
This file contains the code for local centrality.
3) leader_selection
This file contains the code for leader selection.
4) community.py
This file contains the code for our community detection technique.
5) merging_function.py
The file contains the code to merge a list into a dictionary given it has epsilon greater than the specified value. 

The folder also contains the datasets. Please check the origional sources of the datasets, as none is ours. 
To run the code, you need networkx and numpy. Run this code using command below:

python launch_DCS.py -f dataset_name (e.g. python launch_DCS.py -f imdb, python launch_DCS.py -f roadnet.txt, 
python launch_DCS.py -f amazon.txt)
